## Who am I?


I have graduated from the USTB in 2007，and got a double bachelor degree in metallurgical engineering and accounting

---

I am an atypical accountantand.

I have obtained the qualification certificate of intermediate accountant and economist.

I like computer、reading、cycling and so on.

And I am a minimalist.

Minimalism is a tool to rid yourself of life’s excess in favor of focusing on what’s important—so you can find happiness, fulfillment, and freedom.
